A Full Stack Website solution built to build a database of farms across the country and hence analyse the level of animal welfare presently in the nation. 
## Tech Stack
Frontend: React.JS, Redux, Toast Notifications and MaterialUI

Backend: Node.JS, Express.JS

Database: PostgreSQL

Reasons for preferring PostgreSQL over MongoDB:

PostgreSQL being a relational database makes it easier to implement relations among entities. In this case, maintaining the relation between users, farms and the attributes asociated with farms was easily implemented using PostgreSQL
